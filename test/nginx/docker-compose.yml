#
# Set of containers for testing the published Docker Hub image with nginx as a
# load balancer/reverse proxy. This is not used for automated testing.
#

#
# Container names have a domain-like naming scheme to facilitate dnsmasq usage.
# By ending in .doc, which is not a valid TLD, we can easily configure dnsmasq
# to resolve these names to the docker machine. This allows the containers to
# use the same names to refer to each other as the host does when resolving the
# container names.
