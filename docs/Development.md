# Development

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To fetch and build the application dependencies and run tests, you will need
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) *12* or higher due to dependencies.

### Build and Start

Configure the authentication service as described in the documentation, then
build and start the authentication service application:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Docker

Several containers are defined for use with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), including an LDAP server,
Shibboleth Identity Provider, and the authentication service. To build and start
the containers, use `docker-compose` like so:

```shell
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Authentication Extension

The containers for the extension for integrating the authentication service are
in a separate
[repository](https://github.com/perforce/helix-authentication-extension) and can
be installed using `docker-compose` as described in the documentation for that
project.

## Running the Service on HTTP

If for some reason you do not want the auth service to be using HTTPS and its
self-signed certificate, you can use HTTP instead. This is particularly relevant
when developing with a browser that refuses to open insecure web sites, such as
the SAML Desktop Agent with its embedded Chromium browser.

To switch from `http:` to `https:` you will need to change at least three settings:

1. Set `SVC_BASE_URI` appropriately in the auth service configuration.
1. Set service URL in the client system (e.g. Perforce server).
1. Set the callback URL in the identity provider.

## Generating the Certificates

For development we create a self-signed certificate for the authentication
service and use that to sign the client signing request for the server
extension, thus creating the client certificate for the extension. This works
fine for the client since our service will accept its own certificate as a
certificate authority. However, we cannot use this same trick with the service
since the browsers will not accept our fake certificate authority. For now, we
only sign the client certificate and leave the service certificate as
self-signed, since most browsers will tolerate that.

```shell
$ cd certs
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client.key -out client.csr -nodes -days 365 -subj "/CN=LoginExtension"
$ openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out client.crt -set_serial 01 -days 365
$ rm client.csr ; mv client.crt client.key ../loginhook
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -nodes -days 365 -x509 -subj "/CN=AuthService"
```

## Coding Conventions

With respect to the JavaScript code, the formatting follows
[StandardJS](https://standardjs.com). The
[linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) available in
[Atom](https://atom.io) is very good, and catches many common coding mistakes.
Likewise with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the
[StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/vscode-standardjs) extension.

## Design: Sequence Diagram

The `sequence_diagram.mmd` uses [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io) syntax,
which the [mermaid.cli](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) tool reads to
produce the diagram of the authentication workflow.

To generate the diagram, invoke `mmdc` like so:

```shell
$ npm install -g mermaid.cli
$ mmdc -i docs/sequence_diagram.mmd -t neutral -o flow.png
```
