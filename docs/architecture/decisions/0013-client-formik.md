## Context

Web applications often consist of some form of user interface, often through
HTML forms. With user input it is expected to have helpful input validation and
feedback. To that end, form libraries can be very helpful. Given that this
application is uing React, as decided earlier, it makes sense to consider what
the React community has suggested, and that happens to be
[Formik](https://formik.org). It is lightweight and easy to use with just enough
functionality to provide a good user experience.

## Decision

Use Formik as there really isn't any other good alternative that is well
maintained and integrates nicely with React.

## Consequence

None as yet.
