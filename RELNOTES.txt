                            Release Notes for
                        Helix Authentication Service (HAS)
                            Version 2023.2


Introduction

    The Helix Authentication Service is a Node.js application that facilitates
    the integration of identity providers supporting either the OpenID Connect
    or SAML 2.0 authentication protocols.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example 2002.2/30547. YYYY is
    the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the bug fix change level.
    Each bug fix in these release notes is marked by its change number. Any
    build includes (1) all bug fixes for all previous releases and (2) all bug
    fixes for the current release up to the bug fix change level.


Important Notes

    Logging out of a Helix Core or Helix ALM client does not invoke a logout
    with the identity provider (IdP). Depending on the IdP, subsequently
    starting a Helix Core or Helix ALM client might result with the user being
    logged in again without the user being prompted to provide credentials.

    HAS now requires, by default, that both the SAML response and the SAML
    assertion be signed by the identity provider. This addresses vulnerability
    CVE-2022-39299 in the third-party library, node-saml. If your identity
    provider only signs the response, then set SAML_WANT_ASSERTION_SIGNED=false
    in the .env file. If your identity provider only signs the assertion, then
    set SAML_WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED=false. Currently most identity providers do
    not sign both unless configured otherwise.


Supported Platforms

    Linux (x86_64)
        RHEL 7, 8
        CentOS 7, 8.0
        Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04

    The above platforms are tested and subject to regression testing on a
    frequent basis. Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized
    for correction. Any platform not listed above is not actively tested by
    Perforce.

    Windows (x86_64)
        10 Pro
        Server 2019

    HAS is known to work on the Windows systems listed above.


Requirements

    Node.js v18 (LTS)


Documentation

    The HAS Administrator's Guide is publicly available on perforce.com. The
    guide details the steps for installation, upgrade, and configuration of the
    authentication service.


Installation

    Linux

        1. From the download page, select the appropriate Linux distribution
           option. For Linux, HAS is packaged in DEB and RPM formats.

        2. To install, use the appropriate package install command for the
           system, such as `yum` or `apt` for CentOS and Ubuntu respectively.


Upgrade

    The names of the configuration files for IDP_CONFIG_FILE and LOGGING
    in releases prior to 2022.1 ended with the .js extension. With release
    2022.1 the names must now be changed to end with the .cjs extension.

    Package upgrades from releases prior to 2022.1 on CentOS/RHEL systems
    will result in a missing systemd service definition file. To avoid this
    problem, it is necessary to remove the old package and then install the
    new package. After the 2022.1 release, this will not be necessary.


Known Limitations

    No known limitations with the currently released products.

        Support for Node.js v14 has been removed from install script.

    HAS-466 (Change #2467457)
        Configure script will write the bearer token to a file rather

        Configure script will put the p4 ticket as the P4PASSWD in the
        .env configuration file.

New functionality in 2023.1 (2023.1/2422401) (2023/03/24)

    HAS-216 (Change #2387345)
        New setting PROMPT_FOR_AUTHORIZATION that when set to any value will
        prompt the user during the authentication process before proceeding to
        the configured identity provider. This prevents phishing attacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2023.1 (2023.1/2422401) (2023/03/24)

    HAS-420 (Change #2415543)
        Replace UNLINK Redis command usage with DEL to support older releases of
        Redis, such as on CentOS 7.4 when installing Redis from the EPEL
        repository. This fixes an issue in which the cached user object would
        remain in the Redis store for up to 5 minutes rather than being removed
        immediately.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Other changes in 2023.1 (2023.1/2422401) (2023/03/24)

    HAS-249 (Change #2373094)

        The SAML_WANT_RESPONSE_SIGNED and SAML_WANT_ASSERTION_SIGNED settings
        will now default to `true` such that the SAML response and assertion
        from the identity provider must be signed. Previous releases only
        required that one of these was signed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
New functionality in 2022.2 (2022.2/2369727) (2022/11/14)

    HAS-279 (Change #2242671)

        multiple Swarm instances connecting with the same SP entity ID.

    HAS-298 (Change #2266157)
        New setting OIDC_TOKEN_SIGNING_ALGO to specify the signing algorithm
