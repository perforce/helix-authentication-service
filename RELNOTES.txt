                            Release Notes for
                        Helix Authentication Service (HAS)
                            Version 2019.1.1.000002


Introduction

    The Helix Authentication Service is a Node.js application that facilitates
    the integration of identity providers supporting either the OpenID Connect
    or SAML 2.0 authentication protocols.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example 2002.2/30547. YYYY is
    the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the bug fix change level.
    Each bug fix in these release notes is marked by its change number. Any
    build includes (1) all bug fixes for all previous releases and (2) all bug
    fixes for the current release up to the bug fix change level.


Important Notes

    Logging out of a Helix Core or Helix ALM client does not invoke a logout
    with the identity provider (IdP). Depending on the IdP, subsequently
    starting a Helix Core or Helix ALM client might result with the user being
    logged in again without the user being prompted to provide credentials.


Supported Platforms

    Linux (x86_64)
        RHEL 7, 8
        CentOS 7, 8.0
        Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04

    The above platforms are tested and subject to regression testing on a
    frequent basis. Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized
    for correction. Any platform not listed above is not actively tested by
    Perforce.

    Windows (x86_64)
        10 Pro
        Server 2019

    HAS is known to work on the Windows systems listed above.


Requirements

    Node.js v12 (LTS)


Documentation

    The HAS Administrator's Guide is publicly available on perforce.com. The
    guide details the steps for installation, upgrade, and configuration of the
    authentication service.


Installation

    Linux

        1. From the download page, select the appropriate Linux distribution
           option. For Linux, HAS is packaged as in DEB and RPM formats.

        2. To install, use the appropriate package install command for the
           system, such as `yum` or `apt` for CentOS and Ubuntu respectively.


Known Limitations

    Commit/Edge Servers

        When used with the Helix Authentication Extension in Helix Core, support
        for commit/edge server configurations has a known issue (job #102020) in
        which the login URL either does not appear or appears twice.
